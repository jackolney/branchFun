#branchFun
Some fun with branches.
```C++
//git notes on branches
////
//git init
//git remote add origin 'url to repo on github'
//git remote -v
//git push -u origin master #tracks the master on github
//git checkout -b 'branchname' #creates new branch and switches to it.
//#remember to reopen the file you were looking at.
//git add --all
//git commit -m "message"
//
//git push --all -u #This pushes all branches and master to github and tracks upstream.
```
